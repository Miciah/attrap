# attrap

Attrap! provides a command to attempt to fix the flycheck error at point.

Invoke the command `attrap-attrap` when point is on a flycheck error,
and check the results.  Attrap! currently comes with fixers for
`haskell-dante` and `emacs-lisp`. Support for other flycheck
checkers can be added dynamically (see `attrap.el`).
